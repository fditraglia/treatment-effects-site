This is my teaching website for treatment effects, aka causal inference or program evaluation. Click on the navigation menu at the bottom of the page to access lecture notes, videos, and details of the two short courses on this topic that I teach at Oxford: [Treatment Effects: The Basics](./basics) and [Treatment Effects: Beyond the Basics](./beyond). For more information about me and my research, visit my [personal website](https://ditraglia.com). And if you really can't get enough, check out my blog on all things econometric and statistical at [econometrics.blog](https://econometrics.blog).
