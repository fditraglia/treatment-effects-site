This is the website for my lectures on treatment effects, aka causal inference or program evaluation. Click on the navigation menu at the bottom of the page to access lecture notes, videos, references, etc. For more information about me and my research, visit my [personal website](https://ditraglia.com). I post occasional notes on econometrics and statistics [econometrics.blog](https://econometrics.blog).
