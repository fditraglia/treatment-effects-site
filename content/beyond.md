## Overview
This is the website for my [summer school course](https://ouess.web.ox.ac.uk/september-summer-school) which takes place in Oxford each September.

<!--For more information about the summer school see the [course brochure](https://ouess.web.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/ouess/documents/media/september_summer_school_final_1.pdf). If you're interested in attending, you can [apply here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/11FbbGxtKZuLp4DX4hgfKaHv5JDOmRrK9v9SiVHviqVY/viewform?edit_requested=true).-->


## Pre-reading
This course assumes introductory-level knowledge of causal inference along with basic familiarity with the R programming language. If you need to brush up on either of these pre-requisites, you may find the following resources helpful.
- The slides for my short course course [Treatment Effects: The Basics](/basics/)
- My [short video lectures](/videos) on treatment effects basics.
- Chapters 1-2, 4-5, and 7-8 of my [lecture notes](/treatment-effects.pdf) 
- My [crash course on R programming](https://ditraglia.com/erm/01-r-programming.html) and [solutions](https://ditraglia.com/erm/01-r-programming-solutions.html).
- My [introduction to `dplyr`](https://ditraglia.com/erm/02-dplyr-intro.html) with [solutions](https://ditraglia.com/erm/02-dplyr-intro-solutions.html) and [introduction to `ggplot2`](https://ditraglia.com/erm/03-ggplot2-intro.html) with [solutions](https://ditraglia.com/erm/03-ggplot2-intro-solutions.html).

## Lectures
Lectures will take place each morning each morning in the [Manor Road Building](https://maps.apple.com/place?q=Manor%20Road%20Building&ll=51.75676%2C-1.2468&auid=1776925928559182676&lsp=9902&address=Manor%20Road%2C%20Oxford%2C%20OX1%203UQ%2C%20England).
