title = "Treatment Effects: Beyond the Basics"
+++

## Overview
This is the website for my [summer course](https://www.economics.ox.ac.uk/econometrics-pathway) which will take place at Oxford from 12-16 September 2022. If you're interested in attending, you can [apply here](https://www.economics.ox.ac.uk/econometrics-pathway). 


## Pre-reading
This course assumes basic knowledge of causal inference along with basic familiarity with the R programming language. If you need to brush up on either of these pre-requisites, you may find the following resources helpful.
- My short [video lectures](/videos) on treatment effects basics.
- Chapters 1-2, 4-5, and 7-8 of my [lecture notes](/treatment-effects.pdf) 
- [Hands-On Programming with R](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/). See also [my notes](https://qyocwwdd4c.joplinusercontent.com/shares/OsJNRF8AGMOE9NGxpt7YK1) on this book.
- Lessons 1-4 of [Empirical Research Methods](https://empirical-methods.com/)

## Lectures
Lectures will take place in the Skills Lab of the Manor Road Building from 9am-11am on September 12th-16th. Because two hours is a long time, we'll take a twenty minute break halfway through each lecture.

## Practical Classes
Because most students who are taking this course are also registered for Max Kasy's afternoon session on [Machine Learning](https://maxkasy.github.io/home/ML_Oxford_summerschool_2022/) we will hold a *joint practical session* for the two courses from 4:30pm-6pm each day. You are welcome to attend these joint sessions regardless of whether you are in fact registered for the Machine Learning course. A small number of students are registered for Treatment Effects in the morning session and something *other than* Machine Learning in the afternoon session. To prevent scheduling clashes for these students, we will hold alternative practical class sesssions covering *only* the Treatment Effects material from 11:30am-1pm on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday. 

1. Monday: [R Refresher Session](/lab-tidy-simulation.pdf)
2. Tuesday: [Treatment Effects Session 1](/lab-testing-late.pdf)
3. Wednesday: [Machine Learning Session 1](https://maxkasy.github.io/home/files/teaching/ML_Oxford_summerschool_2022/foundations_ml_ps3.pdf)
4. Thursday: [Treatment Effects Session 2](/lab-normal-MTE.pdf)
5. Friday: [Machine Learning Session 2](https://maxkasy.github.io/home/files/teaching/ML_Oxford_summerschool_2022/foundations_ml_ps5.pdf)
